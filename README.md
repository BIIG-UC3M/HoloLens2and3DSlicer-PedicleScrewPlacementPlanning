# Real-Time open-source integration between Microsoft HoloLens 2 and 3D Slicer
## Application for pedicle screw placement planning

This repository contains all the necessary information to replicate the experiments presented in the paper: "Real-Time open-source integration between Microsoft HoloLens 2 and 3D Slicer".
The study presents a novel approach to communicate Microsoft HoloLens 2 and 3D Slicer using OpenIGTLink. This approach is then applied towards pedicle screw placement planning.


This repository presents two planning methods for the abovementioned clinical procedure:

 - AR method: It couples Microsoft HoloLens 2 to 3D Slicer using OpenIGTLink communication protocol. In the final application, a user can move a plane along a virtual 3D model of a patientâ€™s spine and display the corresponding resliced 2D image from the CT.

</p>


 - Desktop method: 2D desktop planner developed in 3D Slicer to compare with the AR application.

There are four folders in this repository:

 - *Resources*: It contains all the resources used in the study, including the patient's information (CT scans and 3D models) and the pedicle screw models.

 - *Desktop_Planner-3DSlicer*: 3D Slicer module that simulates a traditional desktop planner. It is used for the "Desktop method".

 - *AR_Planner-3DSlicer*: 3D Slicer module that complements the AR planning method. It is employed as part of the "AR method".

All models required for this study are already uploaded to Resources/Models/ in both 3D Slicer projects. In case you want to use your own models, update them all to these folders. Please, always use .obj extension for 3D model files.

 - *AR_Planner-Unity*: Unity project developed for the AR planner. It streams the AR application to Microsoft HoloLens 2 in real time. It is the second part of the "AR method".


For more information, read the README.md file within each folder.
