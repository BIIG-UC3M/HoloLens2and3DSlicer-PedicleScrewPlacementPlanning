# Real-Time open-source integration between Microsoft HoloLens 2 and 3D Slicer
## Application for pedicle screw placement planning

This repository contains all the necessary information to replicate the experiments presented in the paper: "Real-Time open-source integration between Microsoft HoloLens 2 and 3D Slicer".
With it



It contains four folders:

 - Resources: It contains all the resources used in the study, including the patient's information (CT scans and 3D models) and the pedicle screw models.

 - Desktop_Planner-3DSlicer: It includes the 3D Slicer module that simulates a traditional desktop planner.

 - AR_Planner-3DSlicer: It has the 3D Slicer module that complements the AR planning method.

The models required for this study are already uploaded to Resources/Models/ in both projects. In case you want to use your own models, please update them all to these folders. Please, always use .obj extension for 3D model files.
 
 - AR_Planner-Unity: It is the Unity project developed for the AR planner.
